In the new version we need to do the following


Enable anyone to add a not yet registered app (Ask the packgename for the playstore fetch)

automaticely download all data (or fail of the app doesn't existe)

then allow user to register feedback on compatibility


Native apps, needs to be promoted beford the android support and easly accesible 


Add a way for user to register (only see their contribution)

Add a moderator role  (can remove bad rating) and a admin role (ban user, remove app)


Rearrage the navbar (left Apps dashboard) (right about logout theme selector)

The app pagination should show all pages (list menu ?)
