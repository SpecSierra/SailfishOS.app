THis is the permission system, it's update V3 for the application


We need the following : 

- A log system, a way to see who did what
- a rollback system based on the log system, user edited but its wrong (manuel action) have a rollback option (like wikipedia)
- A permission system that
   - User -> only can add application and reports
   - moderator -> user + remove reports
   - admin -> user + moderator + all permission (refresh playstore data, users account management, category, )
   Only display what the user has right to
