                <p>
                    SailfishOS.app is a community-driven compatibility database for Android apps on SailfishOS,
                    similar to <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ProtonDB</a>
                    for Linux gaming or <a href="https://appdb.winehq.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wine AppDB</a>.
                </p>

                <h3 class="mt-4">How does it work?</h3>
                <p>
                    We list popular Android apps and show their compatibility status on SailfishOS:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Native Apps:</strong> SailfishOS-native alternatives built specifically for the platform</li>
                    <li><strong>Android App Support:</strong> How well the Android version works through SailfishOS's Android compatibility layer</li>
                </ul>
